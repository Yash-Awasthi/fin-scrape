Receipts at construction depth: enumerate the day's evidence from the
same sampled ngrams corpus the day's scores are computed from.

The DOC API's artlist mode caps out near 38 articles/day/sub-query
(measured 2026-08-04, both sorts identical), so receipts built on it
could only ever show a sliver. But the score itself is computed by
src.fetch_ngrams over ~48 half-hourly minute-files whose toc records
carry every document's url and title -- meaning the articles behind the
number are already flowing through the pipeline. This module re-scans
that corpus for the published day and publishes, per channel, every
English article whose quadgrams matched a registered phrase (anchor
applied per document, exactly as the series matcher does).

What this buys, honestly stated:
  - The receipts are construction-identical: an article listed here is
    an article the day's estimator counted, matched by the same
    tokenizer, the same contiguous-subsequence test, the same anchor.
  - Depth is the corpus's true match count, not an API ceiling. The
    page can say "all N matches in the scored sample" and mean it.
  - No credentials, no rate limits: the files are public GCS objects,
    and this runs anywhere the heal already runs.

Fallback: if the day's minute-files are unavailable (feed gap), this
module delegates to src.receipts (artlist lane) so the payload is never
silently absent -- a bounded sample beats nothing, and _meta.method
says which lane produced the file.

Run by CI daily, or manually:
  python -m src.receipts_ngrams              # latest published day
  python -m src.receipts_ngrams 2026-08-05   # explicit day (debug)
