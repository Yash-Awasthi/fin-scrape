"""Worker entrypoint: `python -m worker.main [--once]`.

Two deployments share one body of work. `--once` runs a single cycle and exits —
that is the live path, a scheduled GitHub Action against Neon
(`.github/workflows/ingest.yml`). Without it an AsyncIOScheduler keeps the same
work running on intervals, for compose and self-hosted runs.

Both go through `_bootstrap`, so a change to logging, pool sizing or migrations
cannot reach one path and miss the other. Jobs are staggered + jittered so they
don't all hammer the network at once; max_instances=1 + coalesce so a slow cycle
never stacks.
