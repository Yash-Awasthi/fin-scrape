"""
M1 build: the historical attention proxy, 1979-2019 (registration
FROZEN in analysis/back_extension_memo.md, founder-signed 2026-08-06,
before any query ran -- this module's filters commit before
credentials exist locally, so the ex-ante order is git-verifiable).

A DIFFERENT construct from the live instrument, and named so
everywhere: monthly share of global event-MENTIONS involving the
registered actor-pair filters, from GDELT 1.0 (1979-2015-02) and
GDELT 2.0 (2015-02-2019-12; the tail exists solely for the overlap
audit). Four channels; shipping is excluded because chokepoint
salience has no actor coding, stated on every surface. Never spliced
into, averaged with, or drawn on the same axis as the 2017+
instrument.
