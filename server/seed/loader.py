"""Curated demo loader. Resolves the dataset's relative day offsets to absolute UTC
timestamps at load time (so every launch shows fresh signal), ingests via the same
deterministic-dedup path as the API (idempotent on same-day re-runs), then seeds
accuracy_outcomes for the directional events and the correlation signals.

Pure resolution (`resolve_events`) is unit-testable without a DB; only `seed` needs a
live pool. Re-running is safe: events dedup by content_hash, accuracy rows are written
only for *newly inserted* events, and seed correlations are replaced (DELETE seed:* first).
