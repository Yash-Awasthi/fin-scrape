"""Build the score-level sensitivity to independent splice ratios.

This never changes the primary series. It applies the independently
estimated ratios from analysis/splice_overlap_audit.py only to store days
that can be identified as mechanically bridged from NGrams under the
production ratio, rebuilds daily and 7-day scores, and publishes the
difference beside the frozen vintage.

The published 2026-08-10 artifact is now a frozen historical study. Rebuilds
read identity-bearing retained NGram evidence and therefore fail closed until
the source has a current signed decision covering that use. Daily workflows do
not call this module while the decision remains pending.
