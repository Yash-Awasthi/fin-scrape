"""Event clustering into storylines.

The same story from five sources currently produces five feed rows. This module
greedily groups events whose subject embeddings are similar *and* that happened
close in time into one storyline, so the feed can collapse the members under a
single top row.

Design:
- `cluster_events` is pure: it takes a `similarity(subject_a, subject_b)` callable,
  so tests can inject fake embeddings (no network, no Ollama).
- `build_storylines` wires it to `finscrape.analysis.embeddings` — the production
  similarity. When Ollama is down `embed()` returns None and `cosine()` returns
  None, so every event becomes its own singleton cluster and the feed renders
  exactly as it did before (graceful degradation).
