"""
Country monitor machinery (V8). Generic over countries/<name>.json.

A country monitor tracks a country's own registered risk channels on
the same substrate and the same construction as the India instrument
(share of monitored coverage, trailing-percentile transform). It is a
MONITOR, never a comparator: its payload stands alone, its numbers
never enter any India series, and the comparator placebo panel is
untouched (countries/RECIPE.md states why).

REFUSE-UNSIGNED, the load-bearing rule: a country file whose _meta
carries no registration (frozen_on date or REGISTERED status) is
skipped with a loud line. The founder's signature is what turns a
draft into an instrument; this module fetching for an unsigned draft
would let the machine make a construct decision, which it never does.
