"""
Receipts drill-down (practitioner layer item 2): for the latest published
day, reconstruct each channel's exact GDELT query, pull a relevance-sorted
sample of matched articles (mode=artlist), and sort them tier-first using
source_tiers.json. Publishes docs/data/receipts.json.

Not a historical archive: GDELT artlist is date-scoped and ad hoc (like
make_datapack's dossier), so only the latest published day is kept --
each daily run replaces it, and clicking into an older day is honestly
labeled "not available" rather than faked. Untiered domains (not yet in
source_tiers.json) sort after every registered tier and are shown as
"unranked", never assumed tier 3.

Run by CI daily, or manually: python -m src.receipts
