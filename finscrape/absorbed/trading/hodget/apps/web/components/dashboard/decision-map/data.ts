/**
 * Decision-map fixture — the plain-language model behind the Decisions page.
 *
 * Every map is DERIVED from a single decision row (the same shape the run-detail
 * decision log reads), so the map's header, KPIs and its nodes can never
 * disagree: a clipped row draws a "Safety reduced it" gate with matching target
 * weights, a "No trade" row draws no execution fill, a vetoed row draws a
 * blocked gate and no fill. The one flagship decision shown in the product mock
 * (`dec_c12f8b7a`, NVDA) matches its values and copy exactly; every other
 * decision id derives a consistent map from the same functions.
 *
 * The page reshapes the map into a plain-language explainer, so alongside the
 * structural fields (weights, sizes, prices) each node also carries the
 * human-readable strings the mock shows — headline, explainer paragraph, advisor
 * words and theses, the committee sentence, the safety reason, ledger fields.
 * These are derived per row too; the flagship's are pinned to the mock.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic — no `Date.now()`/`Math.random()` — so the /demo routes
 * prerender cleanly and server and client agree byte-for-byte. Layout (x/y
 * positions, edges) lives in `layout.ts`; this file is the domain model.
