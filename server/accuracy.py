"""Accuracy backtest + aggregation (Phase 7 trust layer).

Ports the correctness rule from finscrape/accuracy.py (_determine_outcome): an INVEST is
right if price rose ≥1%, a PULL_OUT is right if it fell ≥1%; OBSERVE/CAUTIOUS are
non-directional (neutral). The pure helpers (verdict_outcome, aggregate) are unit-tested;
`backtest` takes an injectable price_fetcher so it runs offline in tests and against
finscrape market_data in the worker. `calibration` (Brier score + confidence buckets)
is shared with finscrape/accuracy.py rather than duplicated.
