"""
Rolling receipts archive (up to seven available committed cache days).

A single day cannot honestly guarantee an article quota: on a dead
channel day, fewer matching articles may exist. Today's receipts stay
the primary evidence (receipts.json, unchanged), and this module publishes
up to seven available days from the same committed corpus day-caches
(data/raw/receipt_days/), every article dated. A channel page carries
the days that actually exist in the cache—possibly fewer than seven—
without one fabricated or padded row.

Construction per day and channel is identical to receipts_ngrams
assembly (same matcher provenance, same tier sort, same syndication
dedup, same lane labels), capped at ARCHIVE_PER_DAY per channel-day to
keep the payload phone-sized. The caches are committed by the daily
lanes, so the archive deepens automatically each day and never goes
stale while the lanes run.
