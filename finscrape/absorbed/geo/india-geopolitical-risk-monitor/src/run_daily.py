    WHY THIS EXISTS
    event_study.json had no lane that could reach it on an ordinary day,
    and the gap was structural rather than accidental:

      * morning.yml runs `run_daily --final-only`, and --final-only
        prints "[4/5] Event study unchanged" and skips it outright.
      * daily.yml runs the full pipeline -- but only for an UNPUBLISHED
        target day. Once the contract lane has published, there is no
        such day, so the step is skipped and the event study with it.

    So on every day the 06:00 contract succeeded -- the good case --
    nothing recomputed it. It sat 8 days old while both lanes were
    green. That is the same shape as the rest of this week's findings:
    a payload whose refresh was a side effect of a step that only runs
    in the failure case.

    This path deliberately takes NO target and touches none of the
    publication guards -- require_ordered_target,
    require_promotion_receipt, _require_exact_target_scores. It is not a
    publish with the checks removed, which is the dangerous thing it
    could be mistaken for; it reads the committed store, recomputes one
    derived payload from it, and stops. It writes docs/data/
    event_study.json and event_study.csv and nothing else, so there is
    no candidate here for a check to be protecting.
