"""An adversary that cannot be argued with: rebuild the index from the
PUBLISHED codebook and the PUBLISHED shares, and diff it against the
published series.

WHY THIS AND NOT A CRITIC
------------------------
The obvious way to push this project harder is a second model that reads
the work and objects to it. That does not work, and this repo has the
evidence. Every real defect found on 2026-08-06/07 was a VERIFICATION
failure, not a reasoning failure:

  * the blind-spot test was true 523/523 times by construction
  * the gap probe sampled a window with zero overlap with the gaps
  * the stamp step was placed wrong twice by reasoning and right once by
    listing the workflow's actual execution order
  * "one easing" was four; the duration test's regex could not see three
    of the durations it was cited as enforcing

A critic agent reasons over the same context and would have caught none
of them. Worse, its loop terminates when the writer produces prose the
critic finds satisfying, which optimises for persuasiveness rather than
truth.

So this adversary is not allowed to have opinions. Its only output is a
number and a diff.

THE RULE THAT MAKES IT BLIND
----------------------------
This module may read ONLY what a stranger can download:

    docs/codebook.html      the stated method
    docs/data/shares.csv    the published quantity
    docs/data/history.csv   the published result

It may not import src.scores or any other module that computes the
index, and `test_blind_replicator.py` enforces that by reading this
file's imports. If the transform here is wrong, the fix is to change the
CODEBOOK until a stranger could get it right -- never to peek at the
pipeline and quietly match it. Matching by peeking is what this is
designed to detect.

WHAT THE CODEBOOK SAYS
----------------------
Quoted from docs/codebook.html:

    "Channel percentile vs its own trailing 730 days, 0-100"
    "Every percentile is computed against the series' own trailing 730
     days, minimum 180 observations, never using future data."
    "Unweighted mean of the five channel percentiles, 0-100"
    "Composite percentile that day (null before 180 trailing obs)"

That is enough to write the transform. It is NOT enough to pin two
choices, and the whole value of this module is that it says so out loud
rather than guessing:

  1. What "percentile" means at ties and endpoints. Strictly-below,
     at-or-below, and midrank all satisfy "0-100" and differ by up to
     100/n points on the same data.
  2. Whether "trailing 730 days" counts CALENDAR days or OBSERVATIONS.
     The series has real gaps (2025-06-15..07-01 is missing upstream and
     is unfixable), so the two readings select different windows.

Rather than picking one, this evaluates the cross-product against the
published series and reports which combination reproduces it. That
turns an ambiguity into a measurement: the winning convention is the
sentence the codebook is missing, and the margin over the runners-up is
how much that missing sentence is worth.
