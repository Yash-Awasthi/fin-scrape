"""Per-client sliding-window rate limiter.

In-memory by design: one API replica is the WorldFin demo topology, so a process-local
deque of hit timestamps is the whole limiter — no Redis round-trip on the hot path.

ponytail: in-memory only. Ceiling = a single API replica (each process keeps its own
window). Upgrade path for >1 replica: back `Limiter.hit` with a Redis sorted-set
(ZADD now / ZREMRANGEBYSCORE < now-window / ZCARD) keyed on `settings.redis_url`.
