"""
V5 measurement quality: the English-bias audit.

For each channel and each registered language (languages.json,
registered before the first fetch), the identical frozen dictionary is
fetched with a sourcelang operator, giving that language's own
coverage-share series. Each series ranks against its own trailing 730
days; the published number per channel is the divergence between the
English percentile and the mean non-English percentile, weekly. A
large positive divergence means the story is louder in English than in
the registered languages; negative means the non-English press is
carrying it harder. This is a language-scope comparison, not evidence
that one language is correct or a representative census of Indian news;
it never enters the composite.

    Bounding work per run made a batch survivable; taking that bound

    missing_keys() returns the registered order every time. Every run
    therefore attempted the same first series, spent its wall clock
    there, and stopped -- so a series that cannot be fetched does not
    merely fail, it starves everything behind it.

    Measured 2026-08-09, seventy-odd runs in: the store held 6 of 15
    series, and the missing nine were exactly the last three channels in
    declaration order (gulf_energy, us_trade, shipping x hin/urd/zho).
    The window was always [gulf_energy_hin, gulf_energy_urd,
    gulf_energy_zho, us_trade_hin], so shipping_* had never been
    attempted a single time. The lane was not slow at those series; it
    had never asked for them.

    Rotating by ordinal day advances the window MAX_SERIES_PER_RUN at a
    time, so every missing series comes up within a few days even if the
    head of the list stays unfetchable, and a run is still deterministic

    GDELT requests, and a single 429 anywhere in the loop raised past the
    write -- so the store was never created, not once, while every
    completed fetch still landed in the chunk cache.

    The workflow around it then read that growing chunk cache as
    progress, re-dispatched itself, and stayed green because the fetch
    step is continue-on-error. Seventy runs across seven days,
    twenty-six on 2026-08-06 alone, none of which could ever have
    finished: a loop that cost real CI minutes to look busy.

    Writing after each series makes the work cumulative. A batch that

    skips them and starts at the ninth -- so the store converges instead
