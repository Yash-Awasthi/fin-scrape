"""
FinScrape Engine — vendored Scrapling-based scraping layer.

Uses the actual Scrapling library (v0.4.6) vendored at
finscrape.engine.scrapling for C-speed HTML parsing (lxml),
TLS fingerprint impersonation (curl_cffi), stealth browser
automation (patchright), and realistic header generation (browserforge).

Three fetch modes:

  - Fetcher:          Fast HTTP with curl_cffi TLS fingerprinting
  - StealthyFetcher:  Patchright with anti-detection (Cloudflare bypass, etc.)
  - DynamicFetcher:   Patchright for JS-heavy pages that need rendering

All return a unified `Response` object (subclass of `Selector`) with
CSS/XPath selectors so the rest of the codebase doesn't care which
fetcher was used.
