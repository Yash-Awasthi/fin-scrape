"""
Daily-score sampling uncertainty (MI3; V5 accelerated by founder order,
2026-08-05 night). The ngrams bridge estimates each day's channel share
from a pooled sample of ~30k documents, so the published score carries
sampling noise the chart should show rather than bury in a file.

Method, stated completely:
  1. For each cached sample day (data/raw/ngram_days/), the channel's
     raw share is the sum of its sub-query group shares over n sampled
     documents. The effective matched count is k = round(share/100 * n).
     Approximation, stated: the registered sum-of-groups construction
     can count one document under two groups, so k is an upper-ish
     effective count; the band inherits the construction rather than
     correcting it.
  2. Wilson 95% interval on k/n gives share bounds.
  3. Both bounds pass through the SAME transforms the point value
     passed through: divided by the channel's published splice ratio
     (ngram_calibration.json), then mapped by the same trailing
     percentile against the primary store (the day's own value included
     in its window, exactly as build_index computes it).
  4. Composite band: mean of the channel bounds. The five channels'
     sampling errors are independent, so the true composite band is
     narrower than this envelope; conservative by construction, stated.

API-era days (before the ngrams switch) have no sampling design of
this kind -- timelinevol is computed over the full monitored corpus.
The payload names both ends of its exact frozen band window; neither
earlier nor later dates inherit a band by implication.
