"""Tests for the one company->ticker map and its word-boundary matching.

Covers the exact failure modes that used to leak garbage tickers into
pipeline.py's valid_tickers gate: substring hits ("arm" inside "pharma",
"target" inside "price target", "citi" inside "Citizens Financial") and
real liquid tickers getting dropped by the stopword list (NOW, ALL, IT,
AI, KEY, GO, ONE).
