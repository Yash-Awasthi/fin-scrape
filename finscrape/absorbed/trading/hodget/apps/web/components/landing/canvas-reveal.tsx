/**
 * Defers the decision-map's one-time entrance stagger until the canvas first
 * scrolls into view. On the landing page the canvas sits below the fold, so
 * playing the stagger on mount wastes it — a visitor scrolls down to a graph that
 * has already assembled. A one-shot IntersectionObserver flips the canvas'
 * `entrance` gate on once the card is ~25% visible; above-the-fold viewports
 * (where the canvas is already visible on load) trigger it immediately. Plays
 * once, never replays.
 *
 * Reduced motion is handled upstream — the entrance keyframe lives in a
 * `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference` block (decision-flow.css) — so a static
 * canvas never depends on the scroll trigger.
