"""
Judge — reads the whole council debate transcript plus the arithmetic
consensus (mean, agreement, dissenter list) and reasons about why the
agents disagree, then hands down its own score/confidence/verdict.

The judge can agree with the arithmetic mean or override it outright.
When the judge LLM is unreachable, judge_debate() returns None and the
caller falls straight back to the arithmetic consensus — zero regression.
