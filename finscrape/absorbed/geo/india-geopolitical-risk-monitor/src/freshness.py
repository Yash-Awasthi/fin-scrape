"""
Every published payload, audited for staleness (2026-08-07).

The China and V5 lanes each failed silently for days. Both were caught
by accident. The generalisation of what caught them is this: a payload
that stops being rewritten does not break, it keeps serving its last
value, and a stale number is quoted exactly as confidently as a fresh
one. status.json watches ten upstream SOURCES; the site serves seventy
endpoints, and nothing was watching those.

So: read every docs/data/*.json, take its `_meta.generated`, compare
against the cadence its lane is supposed to run at, and fail loudly on
anything past tolerance.

Three rules keep this honest rather than decorative:

  * A payload with NO timestamp is a failure, not a pass. Three
    payloads (alt_specs, seasonality, priced_risk) had no `generated`
    field at all, which meant no audit -- this one included -- could
    ever have told whether they were current. They were stamped before
    this module was written, because an auditor that silently skips
    what it cannot read is worse than no auditor.
  * Exemptions carry a written reason and are checked against a list
    that is short by design. "It doesn't need checking" is a claim.
  * It runs in the enrichment lane, never the 06:00 contract. A
    staleness report must never be the thing that stops a publish.

  python -m src.freshness            audit, publish, exit non-zero if stale
  python -m src.freshness --report   audit and print, always exit 0
