"""
GDELT Events v1 daily stream: what happened involving India, counted,
in three layers from one pass over each daily file.

  1. National (data/raw/events_daily.csv): how many events the world's
     press recorded involving India that day, split into verbal and
     material conflict (CAMEO QuadClass 3/4) and protest (root 14), with
     mean Goldstein score, total mentions, and the global row count as
     the normalization denominator (GDELT's coverage grows over time, so
     raw counts drift without it).
  2. Dyads (data/raw/events_dyads.csv): for every partner country, the
     day's India-partner events split cooperative (QuadClass 1/2) versus
     conflictual (3/4), with mean Goldstein and mentions. The relations
     layer: no dictionaries, no curation, just actor codes.
  3. States (data/raw/events_states.csv): events geolocated to an Indian
     state (FIPS ADM1), with conflict and protest counts. The internal
     layer.

Attribution convention: events are dated by the file they arrive in (the
day GDELT recorded them), matching the "when did the world's press carry
this" framing of the salience series, and stated in the codebook.

A day is complete only when it appears in all three stores, so days
collected before a layer existed are reprocessed automatically by the
next backfill batch.

CLI:
  python -m src.fetch_events --update 5      # fill recent missing days
  python -m src.fetch_events --backfill 200  # oldest missing days first
  python -m src.fetch_events 2026-07-29      # one specific day
