"""
G1: tone as a second axis, construction-identical by design.

The G-track rule says every layer is a registered measurement
addition. This lane sidesteps the hardest registration entirely: it
introduces NO new article selection. The day's matched articles --
chosen by the registered phrase dictionaries, cached in
data/raw/receipt_days/ -- are annotated with GDELT GKG's V2Tone by
joining on the article URL in BigQuery. Same articles the estimator
counted; tone is an annotation, not a filter.

Honesty constraints:
  - Context axis only. Tone never enters any score, any percentile,
    or the composite (a founder-signed memo is the only thing that
    could ever change that, per the G-track registration).
  - Fail-closed: without GCP_SA_JSON / GCP_PROJECT_ID in the
    environment this module prints a skip line and writes nothing.
  - Every query is partition-scoped with maximum_bytes_billed capped;
    a query that would scan more dies rather than spends.
  - Coverage is disclosed per day: n_matched vs n_tone_found (GKG
    does not carry every URL; the join rate publishes).
