/**
 * Explainer for the "How it works" tab on the landing page — the five
 * questions the decision map answers, in order. Copy mirrors the decision-map
 * stage headers (components/dashboard/decision-map/layout.ts) and the tone of
 * the "Reading the decision map" blog post.
 *
 * The steps cascade in (60ms apart) the first time the tab is opened —
 * marketing tier, seen once per visitor, mirroring the CanvasReveal entrance
 * on the sibling tab. The tab panel is not `keepMounted`, so this component
 * remounts on every tab switch; a module-scoped "has played" flag (the
 * IntroGate precedent) keeps the cascade to the first open per page load.
