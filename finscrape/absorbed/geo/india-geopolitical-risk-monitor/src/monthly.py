"""
The monthly series (referee finding #33, 2026-08-07).

Economists work in months. The index publishes days, and every user who
wants to put it beside CPI, IIP, trade or an event-study at monthly
frequency has to aggregate it themselves -- which means twenty
different users make twenty different decisions about the same three
traps, silently, and their results stop being comparable.

So the aggregation ships, with the traps handled in the open.

TRAP 1: SHORT MONTHS
    2025-06 is missing sixteen of its thirty days. A mean over the
    fourteen that survive is not "June 2025"; it is a mean over whichever
    fortnight the fetcher happened to get. Months below MIN_COVERAGE
    publish their row -- the date is never silently absent -- but their
    values are null and `refused_reason` says why. A gap you can see is
    a limitation; a gap you cannot see is an error.

TRAP 2: MIXED INSTRUMENTS
    Most days are DOC API counts; some were measured by the Web NGrams
    bridge and divided by an estimated splice ratio (src/provenance.py).
    A month spanning the boundary is a mean across two instruments
    joined by a constant with its own uncertainty. Every row carries the
    day counts of each, so a user can drop mixed months rather than
    discover them.

TRAP 3: AVERAGING RANKS
    The monthly composite here is the mean of daily percentiles, which
    is NOT the percentile of the monthly mean, and the two disagree
    whenever a month is skewed -- exactly the months anyone cares about.
    Both are published side by side (`composite_mean_of_ranks` and the
    share-based columns) precisely so the difference is visible instead
    of resolved by whoever aggregates first. The share columns are the
    ones that mean the same thing in every year; percentiles are ranks
    against a moving two-year window and are offered as convenience,
    not as the recommended input to a regression.
