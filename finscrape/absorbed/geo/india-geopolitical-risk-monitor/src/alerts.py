"""
Alerts, Phase 0 (design/alerts_webhook.md, founder-signed 2026-08-06
"sign alerts"). Computes the three registered triggers from
already-published payloads AFTER the daily publish -- an alert can
never disagree with the site -- and appends to docs/data/alerts.json
(newest first, 90-day retention, stable ids, poll model; no push
delivery in this phase and no email tier at all).

Registered triggers (amendments are dated, append-only, in the signed
design doc):

  T1  band_separated_move: a channel's Wilson 95% band for the new day
      does not overlap the previous day's band.
  T2  composite_percentile_crossing: the composite crosses its
      trailing 90th percentile (730-day window, the instrument's own
      convention) in either direction, and both of today's band edges
      sit on the crossing's side of the threshold.
  T3  integrity_event: the latest scored morning missed its contract
      deadline (from reliability.json -- the instrument's failures
      alert the same channel its successes do). An audit failure
      blocks publication entirely, so it surfaces as the missed
      morning it causes; a dead pipeline cannot emit its own alert,
      and pretending otherwise would be theater.

Alert copy carries numbers and band arithmetic only -- `direction` is
the direction of the COMPLETED move. Nothing here forecasts.
