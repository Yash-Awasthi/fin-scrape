/**
 * Plays the hero intro (`slide-up-fade`) once per full page load, then suppresses
 * it on any later client navigation back to the page — Design.md's rule that
 * marketing intros run once and never replay on back-nav.
 *
 * The "has played" flag is module-scoped, so it survives client navigations but
 * resets on a full reload (the intro plays again on hard reload, as intended). It
 * is read in a `useState` initializer so a re-mounted (back-nav) instance renders
 * already-suppressed before first paint — no post-paint flash. On the initial
 * server render + hydration the flag is `false` on both sides (a fresh module),
 * so the markup matches and there is no hydration mismatch.
 *
 * The flag is flipped in an effect rather than on `animationend`: in dev the CSS
 * animation can finish before hydration attaches a React handler, so an
 * `onAnimationEnd` would be missed and the intro would replay. The effect always
 * runs post-mount. It is deferred a tick and cleaned up so React Strict-Mode's
 * throwaway first mount (immediately unmounted) never marks it played early —
 * otherwise the real mount would suppress the very first play.
 *
 * The entrance itself lives in intro-gate.css, keyed on `data-intro="play"` —
 * the wrapper's direct children cascade in 70ms apart. A "seen" mount matches
 * no animation selector at all, mirroring the decisions-view entrance-gate
 * precedent (`data-entrance`).
