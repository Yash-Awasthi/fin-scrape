"""Ask IGRM, v0: every registered question, pre-answered and published.

The evidence-locked assistant (src/evidence_assistant.py, design/
evidence_locked_assistant.md) answers a registered question space with
deterministic text whose every value is re-verified against source
bytes at render time. Its design doc forbids a public endpoint until
ten launch conditions hold. This module is the v0 that needs none of
them: the full registered question set is answered AT BUILD TIME on the
committed payloads, and the answers -- with their evidence ledgers and
their refusals -- are published as one static payload a page can
render. No model, no backend, no key, no user input ever touches the
renderer. The reader gets the ask-anything surface; the trust boundary
stays exactly where a downloaded JSON's is.

Refusals are part of the product: the payload publishes what the
assistant declines to answer (forecasts, superiority, advice) with its
stable refusal codes, because a reader who sees the refusal behavior
can trust the answer behavior.
