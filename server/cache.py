"""Tiny in-process TTL cache with named tiers (fast / medium / slow).

Replaces the ad-hoc dict cache in routes/data.py. One module so every cached read
shares the same eviction + tier semantics. Values are whatever the producer returns
(already-serialized dicts/lists here).

ponytail: process-local, no Redis. Ceiling = single replica; multi-replica wants a
shared store. Upgrade path: swap `_store` get/set for Redis GET/SETEX keyed the same.
