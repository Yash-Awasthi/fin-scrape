"""Cache-busting versions, derived from content instead of typed by hand.

WHAT WAS WRONG
--------------
Every page linked `site.css?v=20260807f`, and inside that sheet sat

    @import url("tokens.css");

with no version at all. tokens.css is the single source of truth for the
palette, the type ramp and the motion scale -- the file most likely to
change and the one every other sheet depends on -- and it was the one
file no reader would ever be told had changed.

The failure mode is not a stale look, it is a BROKEN one. A returning
visitor gets the new style.css, which says

    animation: igrm-drift var(--dur-ambient) var(--ease-loop) infinite;

against a cached old tokens.css that has never heard of --dur-ambient or
--ease-loop. An undefined custom property makes the whole declaration
invalid at computed-value time, so the rule does not fall back, it
vanishes. This is the same shape as the 2026-07-31 gap-chart crash,
where homepage palette names resolved empty inside site.css.

Three further pages -- corrections, codebook, methodology -- linked
`site.css` with no query string whatsoever, so for anyone who had
visited before, those three were frozen at whatever CSS they first saw.

And the JS was worse: reveal.js and labels.js were pinned at
`?v=20260729a` while the files themselves had moved on.

WHY DERIVE IT
-------------
A hand-typed version is one more thing two places have to agree about,
and this project has now been bitten four times by exactly that: two
copies of the palette, two copies of the keyframes, two copies of the
chart colours, a doc claiming a spacing scale that did not exist. The
answer each time was to compute the second copy instead of maintaining
it.

So: the version of an asset IS the first 8 hex of the sha256 of its
bytes. Change the file, the version changes. Do not change it, and it
does not. Nobody has to remember anything, and `test_asset_versions.py`
recomputes the whole set and fails with the exact command to fix it.

ORDER MATTERS
-------------
tokens.css is imported BY style.css and site.css, so stamping the import
line changes those sheets' own bytes and therefore their own hashes.
Leaves are stamped first and referrers second, and the result is a fixed
point -- running this twice in a row is a no-op, which the test also
checks.
