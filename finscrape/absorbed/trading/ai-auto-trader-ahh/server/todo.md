# AI Entry Timing Fix - Implementation Plan

## Problem Summary

The AI trading system has poor entry timing, causing losses despite correctly identifying market direction. The core issue: **LLMs excel at pattern recognition but fail at knowing WHEN to act**.

### Evidence
- 39.2% win rate despite "high confidence" signals
- SHORT trades consistently worse than LONG (AI following crowd into shorts at bottoms)
- Before filters: AI opened many positions → caught in reversals → losses
- After filters: Either blocks too much, or still loses when trades go through

---

## Root Causes Identified

### RC-1: LLMs Unsuited for Sequential Decision-Making (CRITICAL)
- **Source**: [Frontiers AI Research](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2025.1608365/full)
- **Issue**: AI receives snapshot data, has no memory of price trajectory or momentum decay
- **Location**: `decision/prompt_builder.go:336-433`

### RC-2: Distraction Effect from Prompt Overload (HIGH)
- **Source**: [PMC Research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12421730/)
- **Issue**: 400+ lines of conflicting instructions overwhelm the AI
- **Location**: `ai/openrouter.go:294-406`, custom prompt in strategy JSON

### RC-3: No Signal + Trigger Separation (HIGH)
- **Source**: [Traders Mastermind](https://tradersmastermind.com/fix-your-trade-timing-signal-trigger/)
- **Issue**: AI decides IF, WHEN, and HOW to trade all at once
- **Location**: `trader/engine.go:1459-1498`

### RC-4: LLM Overconfidence & Herding Behavior (HIGH)
- **Source**: [arXiv LLM Trading Analysis](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.15800v1)
- **Issue**: AI confidently enters trades without considering if it's chasing the crowd

### RC-5: Missing Pullback Wait Logic (CRITICAL)
- **Source**: [HighStrike Pullback Trading](https://highstrike.com/pullback-trading/)
- **Issue**: No mechanism to wait for pullback after identifying signal
- **Impact**: Always enters at extended prices with worse risk/reward

### RC-6: No Market Regime Detection (MEDIUM)
- **Source**: [ATLAS Framework](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.15949v2)
- **Issue**: Same strategy used in trending, ranging, and volatile markets
- **Location**: `market/data.go:274-290`

### RC-7: Counter-Trend Filter is BACKWARDS (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Current filter PENALIZES entries when price is below EMA9, but professional pullback trading WANTS this
- **Location**: `trader/engine.go` in `checkEntrySafety`
- **Evidence**:
  ```go
  // Current logic (WRONG):
  if isLong && currentPrice < (ema9-emaTolerance) {
      addWarning("counter-trend", "price is below EMA9", 10, "medium")
  }
  ```
- **Impact**: Blocks good pullback entries, allows bad extended entries

---

## Existing Filters to REMOVE or CHANGE

### Filters to REMOVE

| Filter | Location | Current Behavior | Why Remove |
|--------|----------|------------------|------------|
| `counter-trend` | `engine.go:1750-1757` | Penalizes price below EMA9 for longs | **BACKWARDS** - blocks pullback entries which are the BEST entries |

### Filters to REDUCE/CHANGE

| Filter | Location | Current | Change To | Reason |
|--------|----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| `weak-trend` | `engine.go:1769-1771` | 0.3% EMA spread threshold | 0.15% | Too strict for volatile altcoins |
| `resistance-fomo` | `engine.go:1874-1878` | 15% penalty near 40-candle high | 10% or add context | In strong trends, new highs ARE valid entries |

### Filters to KEEP (Working Correctly)

| Filter | Location | Why Keep |
|--------|----------|----------|
| `trend-mismatch` | `engine.go:1774-1779` | Entering LONG when EMA9 < EMA21 is genuinely bad |
| `momentum-exhaustion` | `engine.go:1785-1793` | Extended price + declining MACD = real reversal risk |
| `liquidation` | `engine.go:1919-1929` | Truly dangerous, must stay as hard block |
| `oi-crowding` | `engine.go:1911-1916` | Herding indicator, valuable for avoiding crowd |
| `wick-rejection` | `engine.go:1832-1838` | Multiple rejection wicks signal reversal |

### Task 0.1: Fix Backwards Filters (IMMEDIATE) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **REMOVE** `counter-trend` check entirely
- [x] **REDUCE** `weak-trend` threshold from 0.3% to 0.15%
- [x] **ADD** `late-entry` check: penalize price EXTENDED >1.5% ABOVE EMA9 (the opposite of current)
- **File**: `trader/engine.go` in `checkEntrySafety`
- **Effort**: 30 minutes
- **Priority**: Do this FIRST before any other changes
- **Commit**: `365f293` - feat: Implement weighted scoring and fix backwards entry filters

```go
// REMOVE this (lines 1750-1757):
// if isLong && currentPrice < (ema9-emaTolerance) { ... }
// if !isLong && currentPrice > (ema9+emaTolerance) { ... }

// ADD this instead:
if isLong && data.EMA9 > 0 {
    extension := (data.CurrentPrice - data.EMA9) / data.EMA9 * 100
    if extension > 1.5 {
        addWarning("late-entry", fmt.Sprintf("Price extended %.1f%% ABOVE EMA9 - chasing the move", extension), 25, "critical")
    }
}
if !isLong && data.EMA9 > 0 {
    extension := (data.EMA9 - data.CurrentPrice) / data.EMA9 * 100
    if extension > 1.5 {
        addWarning("late-entry", fmt.Sprintf("Price extended %.1f%% BELOW EMA9 - chasing the dump", extension), 25, "critical")
    }
}
```

}

type TriggerConditions struct {

```go
type MarketRegime string

const (
    RegimeTrending  MarketRegime = "TRENDING"   // ADX > 25
    RegimeRanging   MarketRegime = "RANGING"    // ADX < 20, Bollinger squeeze
    RegimeVolatile  MarketRegime = "VOLATILE"   // ATR > 2x average
    RegimeExhausted MarketRegime = "EXHAUSTED"  // Extended + declining momentum
)
```

#### Task 4.2: Add Regime-Based Rules

## Notes

- The weighted scoring system implemented earlier helps but doesn't solve the core timing issue
- The two-phase entry system (Signal → Trigger) is the most impactful change
- Start with Phase 1 quick wins to see immediate improvement
- Consider A/B testing new system against old before full rollout
