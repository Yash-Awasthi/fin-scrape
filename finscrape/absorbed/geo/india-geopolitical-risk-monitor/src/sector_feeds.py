"""
E4: per-sector feeds. One machine-consumable JSON per registered
sector, assembled nightly from already-published payloads -- the
single-sector cut of exactly what the exposure page computes, so a
consumer can poll docs/data/sector_textiles_apparel.json instead of
joining four payloads themselves.

Nothing new is computed here: scores from latest.json, bands from
uncertainty.json, weights under the registered rule (the sector as a
whole profile), measured sensitivity cells where a signed NSE mapping
exists. Salience-not-risk travels in every file's _meta.

  python -m src.sector_feeds     writes docs/data/sector_<key>.json x N
