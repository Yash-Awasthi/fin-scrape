"""Byte-deterministic offline audit bundle: manifest, zip and reader verifier.

A stranger who distrusts the site should be able to carry away one artifact and
verify it forever. The full design (design/offline_audit_bundle.md) lists four
pieces beyond the manifest: zip packaging, a stdlib reader verifier, a founder
signature and a timestamp proof.

TWO OF THOSE FOUR NOW SHIP HERE. build_bundle_bytes emits a byte-deterministic
zip (verified identical across repeat builds) and verify_bundle_bytes is the
reader-side verifier that uses zipfile, hashlib and json alone. Measured
2026-08-17: a three-member bundle builds identically twice, verifies clean, and
a single flipped byte in one member is refused as bundle_member_digest_mismatch.

STILL DEFERRED: the founder signature (needs the signing key, so it can only
arrive through a ceremony) and the .ots timestamp proof (needs an external
service). Both are out of this runtime's hands rather than unwritten.

This docstring previously described the module as the manifest half only, and
stayed that way after the zip and the verifier landed. A reader -- including a
later agent -- who trusted it would have understated what exists by half, which
is exactly the failure mode this project keeps paying for: a stale description
does not announce itself, it reads as fact. Verify against the bytes.

Underneath it all is the manifest: a member list that is rights-eligible,
tracked, safely named, digest-matched, and a manifest whose self-digest
reproduces byte-for-byte from committed bytes.

Deny-by-default. Rights-restricted members refuse rather than degrade; a member
whose declared digest does not match its bytes refuses; an unsafe path refuses.
The manifest never contains the raw store -- it proves without containing.

Refusal codes and the rights-restricted glob list are registered in
governance/offline_bundle_contract.json. Codes for the deferred sub-slices
(signature, timestamp, verifier) are reserved there and are NOT raised here;
`tests/test_offline_bundle.py` asserts that boundary so the contract never
claims more than this runtime proves.
