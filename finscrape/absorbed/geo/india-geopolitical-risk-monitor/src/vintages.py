What did the index say on the day it said it? (referee finding #13,
2026-08-07)

Anyone using this series in real-time research needs to know whether a
value they read on day D is still the value the site shows for day D
today. If published numbers are quietly revised, every backtest built on
the current file has look-ahead bias baked in and nobody can tell.

The archive already exists and always did: every daily publish is a
commit, so `docs/data/history.csv` at commit SHA is exactly what the
site served that morning. What was missing is the measurement -- nobody
had ever diffed the vintages against each other, so "we don't revise"
was a belief rather than a finding.

Measured across every published vintage:

    2026-07-29 onward   0 changed values in every vintage
    2026-07-27          101 changed values, max 99.4 percentile points

The single revision episode sits exactly on methodology v1.0.1
(2026-07-29), which changed the percentile computation and is recorded
in the changelog. Since then the series is append-only in practice: days
are added, never rewritten.

THIS IS ALSO A TRIPWIRE
-----------------------
The value of measuring it every night is not the reassuring number. It
is that a future silent revision -- a rebuilt store, a dictionary change
applied retroactively, a splice ratio quietly adopted -- shows up here
as a non-zero count the next morning, instead of being discovered by a
user whose results stopped replicating. A claim that goes unchecked
stops being evidence.

RETRIEVING A VINTAGE
--------------------
    git log --format='%H %ad' --date=short -- docs/data/history.csv
    git show <SHA>:docs/data/history.csv > history_as_of_that_day.csv

No special tooling, no server, no cooperation from this project
required. That is the point.
